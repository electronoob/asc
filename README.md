Assembly Script

I wanted my own scripting langauge which I could
convert to bytecode and then run it on my 
microcontroller projects in the future.

The syntax of the language will appear to be a
variant of an assembly language but with some
C-like features to simplify things a little.

I haven't written a spec, I'm just throwing ideas
into node.js to see what sticks really, too early
to tell anything more.
